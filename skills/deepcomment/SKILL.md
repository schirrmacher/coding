# Deep Comment — Comment Audit

## Purpose

A comment earns its place only when it says something the code cannot. A comment that restates the code is worse than no comment: it is extra to read, and it drifts out of sync the moment the code changes, at which point it actively lies.

So challenge every comment against one test — *could a competent reader derive this from the code itself?* If yes, cut it. If no, it is carrying real information; keep it, and tighten it to just that. The result is code where the few remaining comments are all signal.

Governing rule, above all others: **a comment must not outweigh the code it describes.** A three-line comment over a one-line statement is a defect regardless of how well written it is.

One-shot on a target the user points at. Edit in place, report what changed, then answer normally.

## Target

Resolve in this order:

1. **File / class / function given** → challenge the comments there, edit in place.
2. **Code pasted or quoted in the message** → return the cleaned version in chat, nothing else.
3. **No target** → the comments in the current unstaged/uncommitted changes (`git diff`). The default is to review the comments the user just wrote.

Comment-only edits are low-risk and git holds the recovery path, so edit in place and report every deletion for review via `git diff`. For a wholly untracked file with no committed baseline, show the result and confirm before overwriting.

## The Test — Does This Comment Earn Its Place?

Run every comment through this classifier.

**Keep — the code cannot say it.** Preserve these, byte-exact where you can:

- **Why / intent** — the reason behind a choice the code cannot express: why this algorithm over the obvious one, why this order, why this workaround exists.
- **Warning / constraint / gotcha** — a non-obvious precondition, footgun, invariant, thread-safety note, or ordering requirement. Cutting one reads as permission to break it.
- **Contract / API doc** — a public docstring documenting params, returns, and errors for callers who will never read the body.
- **Provenance** — a link to a ticket/spec/RFC, the source of a magic number, a citation. The credibility lives in the reference.

**Cut or convert — the reader can derive it:**

- **Restates the code** → delete. The line below already says it.
- **Describes "what"** → rewrite as *why*, or make the code self-documenting (rename, extract) and drop the comment entirely.
- **Outweighs its code** → tighten to the one thing the reader cannot derive.
- **Drifted / obsolete** → contradicts the code → delete. A wrong comment costs more than a missing one.
- **Dead commented-out code** → delete. Git holds the history.
- **Noise** → decorative section-dividers, changelog and attribution lines, ownerless TODOs, comments referencing this conversation or the edit being made.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Inventory

Read the target and list every comment: its location, its text, and the code it annotates. Include inline comments, block comments, docstrings, doc-comments, and file/module headers.

### Step 2: Classify

Run each comment through the test above. For each, decide: keep, tighten, convert to why, replace with better code, or delete — and why.

### Step 3: Challenge the "What"

Delete pure restatements. For a comment that names *what* the code does, ask whether the reader needs *why* instead — if so, rewrite it; if the "what" was only unclear because of a poor name, fix the name or extract a well-named piece and drop the comment. The best comment is often no comment.

### Step 4: Challenge Length

Apply the governing rule to every survivor: **a comment must not outweigh the code it describes.** Cut a survivor down to the single fact the reader cannot reconstruct. If a comment is longer than the code it sits over, either the comment is padded or the code needs the explanation broken into the design itself.

### Step 5: Preserve the Load-Bearing

Warnings, contracts, provenance, and negations stay — never trade a safety note or a precondition for brevity. When in doubt about a warning, keep it verbatim.

### Step 6: Apply and Report

Edit in place. Close with the report below. Do not narrate tool calls while working.

## Principles

1. **Comment the why, never the what** — the code already shows what it does.
2. **Cut what the reader can derive; keep what would surprise them** — predictable text carries no information.
3. **A comment must not outweigh the code it describes** — length is a defect on its own.
4. **The best comment is often better code** — a rename or an extraction beats a paragraph.
5. **A drifted comment is worse than none** — delete on contradiction.
6. **Never delete warnings, contracts, provenance, or negations** — a flipped or missing constraint costs far more than any line saved.
7. **Edit in place; git is the undo** — and report every change.
8. **Evidence-based** — every cut points at a concrete comment at its location.

## Report

Close with a compact report, and nothing else:

```
Comments: 14 → 5. Reviewed src/orders/checkout.ts.
Deleted: 8 restatements, 1 commented-out block.
Tightened: 3 down to the why.
Kept untouched: the overdraft precondition on withdraw(), the CVE link on sanitize().
```

Name every load-bearing comment you preserved, so the user can see the safety-critical ones survived.

## Examples

**Delete restatement.** The comment says nothing the line below doesn't:

```
// increment the counter
counter++
```

→

```
counter++
```

**Convert what → why.** The "what" is obvious; the "why" is not:

```
// retry three times
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { ... }
```

→

```
// the gateway drops the first connection after an idle period; retry covers the reconnect
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { ... }
```

**Tighten an overweight comment.** Four lines of prose over one statement:

```
// We use a Set here instead of an array because we need to check
// membership frequently and arrays would be O(n) for each lookup,
// which would make the whole loop O(n^2) and too slow for large
// inputs, so a Set gives us O(1) membership checks instead.
const seen = new Set()
```

→

```
// Set, not array: membership is checked per-iteration — keep it O(1)
const seen = new Set()
```

**Keep the warning verbatim.** No brevity is worth blurring a precondition — this survives untouched:

```
// Must run AFTER migrate(): reads columns that migrate() adds.
// Reordering silently corrupts existing rows.
backfill(db)
```

**Delete commented-out code.** Git holds the history:

```
// const legacyRate = 0.05
// return amount * legacyRate
return amount * taxRate(region)
```

→

```
return amount * taxRate(region)
```

**Replace the comment with self-documenting code.** The comment exists only to decode a bad name:

```
// d is the number of days until the subscription expires
if (d < 7) notify(user)
```

→

```
if (daysUntilExpiry < 7) notify(user)
```
