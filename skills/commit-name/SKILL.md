# Commit Name — Git Commit Generator

## Purpose

Generate a commit message from the conversation context and commit staged files. Produce a subject line and a minimal body that tells the reader **why**, not just **what**.

## When to Use

1. **Manual invocation** — user types `/commit-name` after staging changes
2. **Post-task** — user asks to "commit changes" or "write a commit message"
3. **Proactive** — user says "commit this" or "save my work"

## What It Produces

A git commit with the following message format:

```
<subject>

- <change 1>
- <change 2>
- <change 3>
```

- **Subject** — one short line, max 50 characters, lowercase, imperative mood, no period
- **Body** — max 3 bullet points, each line max 80 characters, only what is not obvious from the diff

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Context

- Review the conversation to identify what was done and why
- Check `git diff --staged` to see exactly what will be committed

### Step 2: Compose Message

- Write a subject line that describes the outcome
- Write up to 3 body bullets summarizing non-obvious changes
- Keep it brief — if the diff speaks for itself, fewer bullets

### Step 3: Commit

- Run `git commit` with the composed message
- Do **not** add a co-author line

## Principles

1. **Imperative mood** — "add feature", not "added feature"
2. **Outcome over activity** — describe what changed, not what you did
3. **Brevity** — only include what the diff does not already say
4. **No decoration** — no scope prefixes, no emojis, no trailing period
5. **No co-author** — do not add coding agent attribution

## Examples

**Input**: User added input validation to a form component

**Output**:

```
add input validation to signup form

- reject emails without domain
- show inline error on blur
```

**Input**: User fixed a race condition in the cache layer

**Output**:

```
fix race condition in cache invalidation

- guard concurrent writes with mutex
- add staleness check before serve
```
