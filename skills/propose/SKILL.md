# Propose — Concrete Design Options

## Purpose

Before committing to a direction, present 1-3 options as **code**. Let the snippet carry the design; strip the prose. The reader should be able to pick by reading the artifacts alone.

## Modes

The artifact changes by what's being proposed; the structure does not.

- **Code / API** (default) — usage snippets showing how the caller would write it
- **Architecture** — a structural sketch: an ASCII diagram or file tree. Triggered by "propose an architecture", "how should we structure…", "service boundaries", "data flow"
- **Naming** — a ranked list of candidate names. Triggered by "propose a name", "what should we call…", "rename…", "name ideas", "suggest a name"

If the phrasing is ambiguous, pick the matching mode; don't ask unless the modes diverge wildly.

## When to Use

1. **Manual invocation** — user types `/propose <design question>`
2. **Pre-implementation** — "what's the best way to..." or "how should I design..."
3. **Naming** — "what should we call this" or "propose a name for…"
4. **Architecture** — "how should this be structured" or "where should X live"
5. **Proactive** — when there are multiple viable shapes and you'd otherwise pick one silently

Skip if there's only one reasonable option or the design is trivial.

## What It Produces

**Code / Architecture** — 1–3 options. Each option is:

- A numbered **label** that names its character (`Option N: <what it is>`, not just "Option N")
- A **code artifact** — the usage snippet (Code) or sketch (Architecture). This is the whole option.

No tradeoff sentences. No supporting paragraphs. If a cost matters, put it in a one-line `// comment` inside the snippet — never a prose block.

Close with **Pick:** — one line: the option and the deciding factor. Nothing more.

**Naming** — a plain bullet list of 3–10 candidates, no notes:

```
## Names for <thing>

- `candidateName`
- `anotherName`
- `yetAnotherName`

**Pick:** `recommendedName` — deciding factor.
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Frame

One line naming what's being designed, only if it isn't obvious from the artifacts. If the question is ambiguous, ask before drafting.

### Step 2: Anchor in Stack Idioms

Identify the language, framework, and libraries in play. Each option must be **idiomatic to that stack**.

- React → hooks and composition before class wrappers
- Go → small interfaces, errors as values, no exceptions
- Rust → traits and ownership before runtime checks
- TypeScript → discriminated unions before string enums
- Python → context managers, dataclasses, async if already async

Check the repo for existing patterns first. If the codebase already solves similar problems a certain way, match it unless there's a real reason to diverge.

### Step 3: Generate Distinct Shapes

Options must differ on a meaningful axis, not cosmetics.

*Code:* positional args vs options object vs builder · sync vs streaming vs callback · free function vs class vs module · explicit config vs convention vs inference · one general interface vs several specific ones

*Architecture:* monolith vs split services · sync call vs queue vs event stream · shared database vs per-service storage · library vs sidecar vs service

*Naming:* grep for casing, prefix/suffix families (`xFor`, `xBy`, `handle*`, `on*`), abbreviation policy. Match existing patterns unless asked to diverge. Generate 3–10 candidates on a real axis (verb-first vs noun-first, domain vs generic, suffix family vs bare name).

Cap at 3 for code/architecture. If more come to mind, drop the weakest.

### Step 4: Show the Code

Lead each option with its code artifact — the caller's snippet (Code) or the diagram/tree (Architecture). This is the option. No framing prose around it.

**Naming mode** ends here: a plain bullet list of candidates, then the **Pick** line.

### Step 5: Pick

One line. The option and the deciding factor. Leaving the choice open pushes the work back to the user.

## Principles

1. **Code, not prose** — the snippet is the proposal; everything else is noise
2. **Costs go in comments** — if a tradeoff matters, it's a one-line `//` inside the snippet, never a paragraph
3. **Idiomatic to the stack** — every option looks native; match repo patterns before importing outside ones
4. **Distinct shapes** — options differ on a real axis, not cosmetics
5. **At most three** — more options dilute the decision (naming: 3–10 candidates)
6. **Always pick** — one line naming the option and the deciding factor

## Examples

**Input**: `/propose how should the new HTTP client handle retries?`

**Output**:

````markdown
## HTTP retry handling

### Option 1: Inline per call

```ts
const user = await client.get('/users/1', {
  retry: { attempts: 3, backoff: 'exponential' }, // repeated at every call site
})
```

### Option 2: Configured at construction

```ts
const client = new HttpClient({
  retry: { attempts: 3, backoff: 'exponential' }, // one policy per client
})

const user = await client.get('/users/1')
```

### Option 3: Default with per-call override

```ts
const client = new HttpClient({ retry: { attempts: 3 } })

const user = await client.get('/users/1')
const report = await client.get('/reports/heavy', { retry: { attempts: 0 } })
```

**Pick:** Default with override — most calls stay terse; outliers opt out without a second client.

**Input**: `/propose API for feature flag checks in TypeScript`

**Output**:

````markdown
## Feature flag API

### Option 1: Single function, string key

```ts
if (isEnabled('checkout.v2', { userId })) { // typos silent until runtime
  renderCheckoutV2()
}
```

### Option 2: Generated flag constants

```ts
import { Flags } from './flags.gen' // needs a codegen step in the build

if (Flags.CheckoutV2.isEnabled({ userId })) {
  renderCheckoutV2()
}
```

**Pick:** Generated constants if codegen already runs; otherwise string key with a lint rule pinning valid names.
````

**Input**: `/propose a name for the function that resolves a user's effective permissions across roles and overrides`

**Output**:

````markdown
## Names for permission resolution function

- `effectivePermissionsFor`
- `resolvePermissions`
- `computeEffectivePermissions`
- `permissionsFor`
- `mergedPermissionsFor`

**Pick:** `effectivePermissionsFor` — names the concept and fits the `rolesFor` / `overridesFor` suffix family.
````

**Input**: `/propose an architecture for the new ingestion pipeline`

**Output**:

````markdown
## Ingestion pipeline architecture

### Option 1: Single service, in-process stages

```
[ HTTP intake ] → [ validate → enrich → persist ]  (one service)
                                     ↓
                                 Postgres
// slow enrichment blocks intake; no failure isolation
```

### Option 2: Queue between intake and processing

```
[ HTTP intake ] → SQS → [ worker: validate → enrich → persist ] → Postgres
// intake acks fast, workers scale; a queue to operate
```

### Option 3: Stage-per-service with a queue between each

```
[ intake ] → Q1 → [ validate ] → Q2 → [ enrich ] → Q3 → [ persist ] → Postgres
// each stage scales/fails alone; three services + three queues to own
```

**Pick:** Queue between intake and processing — decouples intake from variable enrichment cost without the tax of stage-per-service; split further later if one stage bottlenecks.

**Input**: `/propose how to expose pagination on the list endpoints`

**Output**:

````markdown
## Pagination shape

### Option 1: Offset + limit

```http
GET /api/users?offset=40&limit=20
```

```json
{ "data": [], "total": 1284 }
```

### Option 2: Cursor

```http
GET /api/users?limit=20&cursor=eyJpZCI6NDB9
```

```json
{ "data": [], "next_cursor": "eyJpZCI6NjB9" }
```

**Pick:** Cursor — the list endpoints are append-mostly feeds; nobody needs random-access paging and the perf curve stays flat.
