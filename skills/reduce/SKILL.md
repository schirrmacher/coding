# Reduce — Complexity Reduction Framework

## Purpose

Deeply think and reduce the complexity of the code specified by `$ARGUMENTS` (a file, snippet, or reference from context). This is not a cleanup pass — it questions whether each step, each piece of state, and each location is justified at all.

Related but distinct:
- **`/improve-readability`** rearranges code for clarity without changing what it does.
- **`/simplify`** cleans up the diff for reuse and efficiency.
- **`/reduce`** asks the harder question: *should this code exist at all, in this shape, in this place?*

## When to Use

1. **Manual invocation** — user types `/reduce <file|code-target>`
2. **Pre-refactor** — before a larger restructuring, to see what can be removed first
3. **Proactive** — user says "reduce complexity", "minimize this", or "challenge this code"

## Workflow

Walk the four analysis steps before proposing any change. Skipping ahead produces cosmetic edits, not reductions.

### Step 1: Identify the Abstract Recipe

Strip the code down to the underlying **core steps** in plain words. Ignore syntax, framework, and naming.

- What is the input?
- What is the output?
- What is the minimal sequence of operations connecting them?
- Write the recipe as 3–7 bullet points. If it takes more, the code is doing more than one thing.

### Step 2: Identify the Minimal Data, State, and Access

For each step in the recipe, list the **minimum** it needs:

- Which fields of which inputs?
- Which pieces of state must persist across steps?
- Which external resources (DB, network, filesystem, globals) are actually touched?

Anything carried but unused is a candidate for removal. Anything passed through layers untouched is a candidate for relocation.

### Step 3: Check the Abstraction Level

For each piece of data, state, or access, ask:

- Is it handled at the level where its meaning lives, or one layer too high / too low?
- Does this module own the concept, or is it borrowing it from a neighbor?
- Would the concept be clearer if defined where it is used, or where it originates?

Misplaced abstractions are the #1 source of code that "feels" complex even when each line is simple.

### Step 4: Separate the Steps

Lay the steps out as if they were independent. Make dependencies visible:

- Which steps share state? (a real dependency)
- Which steps share code paths only because they were written together? (a false dependency)
- Which steps could swap order with no behavior change? (no dependency at all)

A step that depends on nothing belongs somewhere else, or nowhere.

### Step 5: Challenge Every Step

For each step from the recipe, ask the four questions in order:

1. **Is this step needed?** What breaks if it's removed? If nothing breaks, delete it.
2. **Can it be simplified with the minimal data?** Strip the step to operate only on what Step 2 said it needs.
3. **Does it overlap another step?** Merge or extract the common core. Two steps doing 80% of the same work usually want to be one.
4. **Is it in the right place?** A step that operates at a different abstraction level than its neighbors belongs in the layer that matches.

### Step 6: Propose Changes

Present the reductions as a short, ordered list. For each:

- The step (or piece of state) involved
- Which question it failed (necessity / minimal data / overlap / placement)
- The concrete change

Do **not** apply changes silently — propose them, then wait for the user to choose what to apply. A reduction that the user disagrees with is worse than no reduction at all.

## Principles

1. **Recipe first, code second** — never propose a change before the abstract recipe is on the table
2. **Minimal data is load-bearing** — most overcomplication comes from passing more than the step needs
3. **Wrong-level beats wrong-name** — a misplaced abstraction won't be fixed by renaming
4. **Deletion is the strongest reduction** — prefer removing a step to simplifying it
5. **Propose, don't apply** — the user owns the call on whether the reduction is worth it

## Output Shape

```markdown
## Recipe
1. <core step>
2. <core step>
3. <core step>

## Minimal data per step
- Step 1 needs: <fields / state / access>
- Step 2 needs: <fields / state / access>
- ...

## Misplacements
- <data/state> handled in <here> but conceptually belongs in <there> because <reason>

## Proposed reductions
1. **<Step>** — fails <necessity|minimal-data|overlap|placement>. Change: <concrete>.
2. **<Step>** — fails <…>. Change: <concrete>.

## Recommendation
<which 1–2 reductions to apply first and why>
```

## Example

**Input**: `/reduce src/orders/checkout.ts`

**Output**:

````markdown
## Recipe
1. Receive a cart
2. Validate the cart's items are in stock
3. Compute the total
4. Charge the customer
5. Persist an order record

## Minimal data per step
- Validate: item IDs and quantities — not prices, not customer
- Total: item prices and quantities — not stock state
- Charge: customer payment token and total — not items
- Persist: item IDs, total, customer ID, payment receipt

## Misplacements
- `taxRate` is read from cart-builder config but used only in `computeTotal` — it belongs in the pricing module
- `validateStock` calls `inventoryService.reserve()` which both checks AND mutates — the mutation belongs in a separate step after charge succeeds, not during validation

## Proposed reductions
1. **Step 2 (validate)** — fails *placement*. The reserve-on-validate behavior couples stock mutation to an early step; move reservation to a new step after step 4 so a failed charge doesn't orphan reservations.
2. **Step 3 (total)** — fails *minimal data*. Currently receives the full cart object; pass only `items[]`. Removes the need for the function to know about the cart wrapper.
3. **`logCheckoutAttempt` call inside step 2** — fails *necessity*. Already logged by the request middleware; delete the duplicate.
4. **`formatLineItems` and `serializeForReceipt`** — fail *overlap*. Both walk the same items list and produce 80% the same fields; merge into one `presentLineItems(items, audience)` taking an audience flag.

## Recommendation
Apply (1) first — it's the only one with a correctness implication (orphaned reservations on failed charges). Then (4), which removes the most code. (2) and (3) are small cleanups once the bigger shape settles.
