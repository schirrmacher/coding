# Improve Readability — Code Clarity Framework

## Purpose

Improve the **readability** of the code specified by `$ARGUMENTS`. Apply six targeted transformations that make code easier to scan, understand, and maintain:

- **Flatten nesting** — guard clauses and early exits first, main logic at one indent level
- **Extract inline complexity** — move complex inline data structures and closures into named variables or functions
- **Rename for clarity** — names must be understandable in their surrounding context
- **Group by cohesion** — cluster related lines together, separate groups with blank lines
- **Comment only the why** — only when the reason cannot be expressed as code
- **Order deliberately** — arrange code by what the reader needs to understand first

## When to Use

1. **Manual invocation** — user types `/improve-readability <file|code-target>`
2. **Post-implementation** — user asks to "clean up" or "make this more readable"
3. **Proactive** — user says "flatten nesting", "refactor for clarity", or "improve readability"

## What It Produces

In-place edits that preserve identical behavior:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| brief description of how the code was | what changed |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Flatten Nesting

- Find any branch whose body exits the surrounding scope — `return`, `continue`, `break`, `throw`, `panic` — regardless of the construct it lives in (`if`, `match`/`switch` arm, `case`, `try/catch`, destructure-with-fallback)
- Lift each terminating branch to a flat guard clause at the base indent of its scope, even when it means inverting a `match` or `switch` into an `if let` / early-exit form
- Test: if you delete the main body after the branch, does the branch still make sense on its own? If yes, it's a guard — lift it
- Keep main logic at a single indent level

### Step 2: Extract Inline Complexity

- Find complex inline data structures, closures, and deeply nested object literals passed as arguments
- Pull them into named variables or functions above the call
- Prefer a named local over a single-use helper — promote to a function only when there's a second call site, the name needs to appear in stack traces, or inlining would re-nest the caller
- Make the call site scannable at a glance

### Step 3: Rename for Clarity

- Find single-letter, abbreviated, or ambiguous names
- Rename to be understandable in context
- Match the abstraction level of the surrounding code

### Step 4: Group by Cohesion

- Cluster related lines together
- Separate groups with blank lines
- Add a short comment above a group only if its purpose is not obvious from the code

### Step 5: Comment Only the Why

- Remove comments that restate the code
- Add comments only when the reason cannot be expressed as code
- Never add comments that reference this conversation or the changes being made

### Step 6: Order Deliberately

Apply as the final step after all other changes:

- **Critical configuration and variables** — at the top
- **Core purpose** — the most interesting or important part next, not boilerplate or helpers
- **Supporting details** — utilities and edge cases last
- **Cohesion groups** — in logical reading order

## Principles

1. **Never change logic** — only flatten, extract, rename, group, comment, and reorder
2. **Verify identical behavior** — mentally confirm nothing changes functionally
3. **No conversation references** — never add comments about the refactoring itself
4. **Why over what** — explain design decisions, not code mechanics

## Examples

### Flatten nesting

Bad:

```
process(order)
  if order exists
    if order.items not empty
      if order.status is pending
        total = calculateTotal(order.items)
        charge(order.customer, total)
        return order
      else
        throw 'already processed'
    else
      throw 'no items'
  else
    throw 'no order'
```

Good:

```
process(order)
  if not order          -> throw 'no order'
  if items empty        -> throw 'no items'
  if status not pending -> throw 'already processed'

  total = calculateTotal(order.items)
  charge(order.customer, total)
  return order
```

### Flatten nesting — terminating match/switch arms

Bad — the failure arm is a mini state machine buried inside a value-binding match; the success arm is trivial. The reader has to parse both arms to see the control flow:

```
validated = match result:
  success(value) -> value
  failure(detail) ->
    state.retries += 1
    if state.retries > maxRetries
      throw 'retries exhausted'
    state.messages.push(retryPrompt(detail))
    emit(turnEnd)
    continue
```

Good — the terminating arm becomes a flat guard; the happy path falls through at base indent:

```
if result is failure(detail)
  state.retries += 1
  if state.retries > maxRetries -> throw 'retries exhausted'

  state.messages.push(retryPrompt(detail))
  emit(turnEnd)
  continue

validated = result.value
```

The tell for this transform: one arm is trivial (just binds the value), the other is substantive with its own branching and exits. The match is disguised control flow — lift the substantive arm to a guard.

### Rename for clarity

Bad:

```
calc(d, r, t)
  v = d.filter(x => x.a > t)
  return v.reduce((s, x) => s + x.a * r, 0)
```

Good:

```
discountedTotal(orders, rate, minAmount)
  eligible = orders.filter(o => o.amount > minAmount)
  return eligible.reduce((sum, o) => sum + o.amount * rate, 0)
```

### Extract inline complexity — inline literal arguments

Bad — the inline literal pushes the call apart vertically; the reader has to scan 7 lines to see what `emit` is being called with:

```
emit(
  runtime,
  spec,
  {
    kind: 'agentEnd',
    turns: state.turn,
    status: 'completed',
  },
)
```

Good — name the constructed value, then pass the name. The call collapses to one scannable line; the literal's meaning is carried by the variable name:

```
agentEnd = {
  kind: 'agentEnd',
  turns: state.turn,
  status: 'completed',
}

emit(runtime, spec, agentEnd)
```

Applies whenever a function call's arguments span multiple lines purely because of an inline literal — even a small one. The indented block inside a call is an anonymous value; giving it a name splits "what is this value" from "what do we do with it."

### Extract inline complexity

Bad — data structure and closure inline obscure the call:

```
schedule({
  task: 'sync',
  retries: 3,
  backoff: { initial: 100, max: 5000, factor: 2 },
  onFailure: (err, ctx) => {
    log(err)
    if ctx.attempt < 3
      ctx.retry()
    else
      alert(ctx.task, err)
  }
})
```

Good — named variable and function make the call scannable:

```
retryPolicy = { initial: 100, max: 5000, factor: 2 }

syncJob = {
  task: 'sync',
  retries: 3,
  backoff: retryPolicy,
  onFailure: retryOrAlert
}

schedule(syncJob)

retryOrAlert(err, ctx)
  log(err)
  if ctx.attempt < 3 -> ctx.retry()
  else               -> alert(ctx.task, err)
```

### Extract deeply nested object literals

Bad — nested JSON built inline inside a function call:

```
createClient(
  buildConfig({
    auth: {
      provider: 'oauth',
      credentials: {
        clientId: env.CLIENT_ID,
        clientSecret: env.CLIENT_SECRET,
        scopes: ['read', 'write', 'admin']
      },
      refresh: { enabled: true, interval: 3600 }
    },
    retry: { attempts: 3, backoff: { base: 100, max: 5000 } }
  })
)
```

Good — each concern extracted into a named variable:

```
scopes = ['read', 'write', 'admin']

credentials = {
  clientId: env.CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: env.CLIENT_SECRET,
  scopes: scopes
}

authConfig = {
  provider: 'oauth',
  credentials: credentials,
  refresh: { enabled: true, interval: 3600 }
}

retryPolicy = { attempts: 3, backoff: { base: 100, max: 5000 } }

config = buildConfig({ auth: authConfig, retry: retryPolicy })
createClient(config)
```

### Group by cohesion

Bad — dense wall of loosely related lines:

```
initApp()
  db = connectDB(config.db)
  cache = createCache(config.cache)
  logger = setupLogger(config.log)
  router = createRouter()
  router.use(authMiddleware)
  router.use(rateLimiter)
  router.mount('/users', userRoutes)
  router.mount('/orders', orderRoutes)
  server = createServer(router)
  server.onError(logger.error)
  server.listen(config.port)
  logger.info('started on ' + config.port)
```

Good — grouped by concern with blank lines between:

```
initApp()
  db = connectDB(config.db)
  cache = createCache(config.cache)
  logger = setupLogger(config.log)

  router = createRouter()
  router.use(authMiddleware)
  router.use(rateLimiter)
  router.mount('/users', userRoutes)
  router.mount('/orders', orderRoutes)

  server = createServer(router)
  server.onError(logger.error)
  server.listen(config.port)
  logger.info('started on ' + config.port)
```

### Comments

Bad — restating the code:

```
// set status to active
user.status = 'active'
```

Good — explaining a non-obvious reason:

```
// prefer reactivation over new account to retain history
user.status = 'active'
```

### Order deliberately

Bad — file level: config buried, helpers before purpose, related pieces scattered:

```
delay(ms) -> ...

class ProfileCache
  get(id) -> ...
  set(id, data) -> ...
  invalidate(id) -> ...

buildHeaders(token) -> ...

RETRIES = 3
BACKOFF = 100
BASE_URL = '/api/v2'

export fetchProfile(id, token) -> ...
export updateProfile(id, data, token) -> ...

formatProfile(raw) -> ...
```

Good — file level: config at top, then the interesting part, then supporting pieces grouped by what they support:

```
RETRIES = 3
BACKOFF = 100
BASE_URL = '/api/v2'

export fetchProfile(id, token) -> ...
export updateProfile(id, data, token) -> ...

class ProfileCache
  get(id) -> ...
  set(id, data) -> ...
  invalidate(id) -> ...

formatProfile(raw) -> ...
buildHeaders(token) -> ...
delay(ms) -> ...
```

Bad — class level: internals before the interface, construction mixed with behavior:

```
class OrderProcessor
  _validateItem(item) -> ...
  _applyDiscount(item, code) -> ...

  constructor(gateway, inventory)
    this.gateway = gateway
    this.inventory = inventory

  _reserveStock(items) -> ...

  submit(order) -> ...
  cancel(orderId) -> ...
```

Good — class level: construction, then public interface, then internals:

```
class OrderProcessor
  constructor(gateway, inventory)
    this.gateway = gateway
    this.inventory = inventory

  submit(order) -> ...
  cancel(orderId) -> ...

  _validateItem(item) -> ...
  _applyDiscount(item, code) -> ...
  _reserveStock(items) -> ...
```

Bad — function level: concerns scattered, reader can't tell what matters:

```
deployService(service, env)
  logDir = env.logDir or '/var/log'
  ensureDir(logDir)
  pidFile = logDir + '/' + service.name + '.pid'
  if fileExists(pidFile) -> throw 'already running'
  artifact = buildArtifact(service.source)
  checksum = hash(artifact)
  previous = getRunningChecksum(service.name)
  if checksum == previous -> return 'no changes'
  healthCheck = service.healthCheck or '/health'
  timeout = env.timeout or 30
  stopExisting(service.name)
  instance = startInstance(artifact, env)
  waitUntilHealthy(instance, healthCheck, timeout)
  writePid(pidFile, instance.pid)
  notifyTeam(service.name, checksum)
  return instance
```

Good — function level: config, then guard rails, then the interesting part (build, deploy, verify):

```
deployService(service, env)
  logDir = env.logDir or '/var/log'
  healthCheck = service.healthCheck or '/health'
  timeout = env.timeout or 30

  pidFile = logDir + '/' + service.name + '.pid'
  if fileExists(pidFile) -> throw 'already running'

  artifact = buildArtifact(service.source)
  checksum = hash(artifact)
  if checksum == getRunningChecksum(service.name) -> return 'no changes'

  stopExisting(service.name)
  instance = startInstance(artifact, env)
  waitUntilHealthy(instance, healthCheck, timeout)

  writePid(pidFile, instance.pid)
  notifyTeam(service.name, checksum)
  return instance
```
